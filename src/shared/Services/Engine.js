              <h2>Check Engine Light in Philadelphia</h2>
              <p>

                expensive repair looming on the horizon. However, with the right
                technical team on their side there’s no need to panic. Savage

              <h3>What is an Engine Light Check?</h3>
              <p>
                Basically, when we do an engine light check, we use a set of
                sophisticated tools to diagnose any issues with your engine or
                transmission. These tools tell us a lot. They read codes from
                your car’s computer that reveal important things. For example,
                we learn if your engine is burning too much oxygen, if your air
                flow sensor or spark plugs need to be replaced, or if the
                problem is as simple as a loose or damaged gas cap. It’s
                critical to get it diagnosed quickly if the light is illuminated
                on your dash.
              </p>
              <h3>Why is it Important to get your Engine Light Checked?</h3>
              <p>
                The way your engine runs affects its efficiency. If you are
                experiencing slow, sluggish acceleration, there may be a problem
                with your engine. Importantly, fuel efficiency might be
                compromised if there is an engine issue. A malfunctioning
                transmission could create hazards for yourself and others. Our
                certified technicians in the Bucks County and Princeton, NJ area
                suggest taking your car in for a diagnostic should you notice
                the light is on. We assure you that our diagnosis tools are the
                best the industry has to offer. Remember, the earlier you get it
                checked, the better.
              </p>

                What will happen if I Put Off Getting the Engine Light Checked?
              </h3>
              <p>
                On the wild and fast roadways, a stuttering vehicle is a
                dangerous vehicle. Any delay in your vehicle’s performance could
                get you into an accident. There is a reason that the light is
                illuminated. The fix could be simple. But if the problem is more
                complex, a timely diagnostic will help you save money. Repairs
                down the road could be much more costly. Why not bring your car
                in for a diagnostic today?
