              <h3>Why Choose Low Rolling Resistance Tires?</h3>
              <p>
                The reason many drivers choose a hybrid car is fuel efficiency.
                Low rolling resistance tires are typically considered the fuel
                efficient tire of choice because they maximize the output of the
                vehicle’s driving range. Simply put, low rolling resistance
                tires help increase a vehicle’s energy. A competent set of tires
                increases fuel efficiency so your tires roll smoothly and
                acceleration doesn’t drag. Standard tires need more energy to
                roll. But low rolling resistance tires use less energy to travel
                distances.

              <h3>What is Life Span of Low Rolling Resistance Tires?</h3>
              <p>
                Well, the answer to that question depends on how you drive your
                vehicle, how often you check the air pressure and balance the
                tires, regular tire rotations, and also the quality of the tires
                you buy. That said, it’s generally known that the shallower
                tread of these tires leads them to be replaced more often than
                conventional tires. They can also be more expensive than
                standard ones. However, rising fuel costs over the long run show
                that the savings in fuel will balance out the cost of the tires.
                According to the Energy Information Agency, the average American
                drives over 12,000 miles a year and consumes an average of 550
                gallons of fuel. Edmund’s, an informational resource on
                vehicles, says that the total cost of ownership for low rolling
                resistance tires can be 8% <i>less</i> than convention tires
                when fuel savings are accounted for.
