                When you’re merging on the highway, you want your electric motor
                to be performing optimally. Your electric car is powered by an

                creates a smooth and tight acceleration. If something’s amiss in
                your engine and you start noticing hesitations or stutters, it’s
                time to bring your electric car to our skilled technicians. The
                key to great auto repair is troubleshooting the issue. Our
                qualified technicians are equipped to handle the best diagnostic
                equipment. We troubleshoot the problem so you don’t pay for
                unnecessary repairs. At 60 miles an hour, you don’t want a
                troubled engine when your family is in the backseat.
