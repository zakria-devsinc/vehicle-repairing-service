                  The Environmentally Sustainable and Conscious Choice for Oil

                Just because your engine oil is dirty, doesn’t mean that it
                can’t have other uses. Did you know that used motor oil can be
                used to generate electricity and heat? When we change the oil in
                vehicles at Savage Automotive, we are very conscious about what
                we do with the waste. In fact, we use that oil to heat our shop
                during the cold winter months with a specialized waste oil
                heater. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that
                millions of gallons of used motor oil are improperly disposed of
                every year. Make the environmental choice by supporting a
                business that puts recycling used motor oil at the forefront of
                its operations.{" "}

                <b>How often do you need an oil change?</b> An oil change is
                recommended every 3,000-5,000 miles. After months of use, a
                vehicle’s oil becomes contaminated with debris. As an engine
                runs, debris and particles pass through the filter into its
                engine and oil. The debris needs to be cleaned out by changing
                the oil and replacing the filter. Regular oil changes extend
                engine life by ensuring the vehicle is properly lubricated.
                Clean oil keeps your engine clean and operating at its maximum
                potential, so you don’t need to worry about costly engine
                repairs in the future.

                <b>Benefits of An Oil Change:</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Better Gas Mileage</b> – A dirty engine is a poorly
                performing engine. Proper, clean lubrication and friction enable
                an engine to run more efficiently.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Longer Engine Life </b>– Just like working out is good for
                the longevity of our bodies, running your vehicle on clean oil
                keeps it in service longer.
