              <p>
                Savage Automotive is a family-owned and operated auto group,
                currently commanded by Joe Rakowski. Savage Automotive has been
                serving the community proudly for well over 45 years, and
                Rakowski took over the business for his father in 2003.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rakowski loves nothing better than to hear “no one could fix it
                so we brought it to you.” Rakowski served the navy as a defense
                contractor, and has extensive knowledge of computer systems and
                mechanics which makes Savage Automotive stand out from their
                competition.

                Our technicians have the know-how to troubleshoot and assess
                most points-of-failure within automobiles. Savage’s technicians
                also receive monthly training in the latest and greatest
                techniques.

              </p>
              <p>
                We do things which are as simple as servicing a “check engine”
                light. We also do battery and electrical work on all hybrid and
                electric cars. We diagnose electric motors and perform extensive
                and in-depth electrical repair on automobiles, utilizing our
                advanced knowledge in automotive electronics and computer
                systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our garage has more equipment than most dealerships. We provide
                brake repair, oil changes, tire replacement and alignment.
                Savage Automotive will replace and repair hybrid batteries at
                affordable rates.

              </p>
              <p>
                We want our customers to come to us seeking a relationship
                instead of just a cheap deal. We set the bar high for our staff
                and never stop learning. We pledge to perform and succeed at
                tasks not offered at many dealerships. We are proud to
                specialize in hybrid cars, but we can perform work on anything.

                Don’t wait for another company’s patience and understanding. We
                offer that and more right away at Savage Automotive. We will
                make sure that you receive quality service that doesn’t require
                frequent return visits, and on top of that, we’ll even educate
                you, so that you know more about your car and the issues it has,
                and may possibly have in the future.
