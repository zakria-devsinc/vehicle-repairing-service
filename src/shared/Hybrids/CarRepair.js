                At Savage Automotive, we understand that your hybrid vehicle is
                an investment. Also, we know that it’s equally important to
                protect your investment so that your vehicle performs optimally
                for its lifetime. You need a technician that understands your
                vehicle and uses the appropriate tools. We know how hybrids
                function and we perform electrical work and computer diagnostics
                that few other automotive shops can supply.
              </p>

                Sure, you could take your hybrid car to a dealership. But that’s
                a lifelong relationship that may not be in your best interest.
                As many have experienced, auto work done at dealerships is
                costly. Dealerships tend to replace entire parts rather than fix
                them. They also charge top dollar for parts and services. But
                this doesn’t have to be the case. You can choose Savage
                Automotive. We have over 40 years of experience in the
                automotive repair business and a legacy of satisfied clientele.

                We realize that your choice of an auto technician to service
                your hybrid throughout its life is an important one. The
                technician you choose should match the features of the hybrid
                itself: intelligently modern, technologically advanced, and
                environmentally sound. Our cutting-edge facility attracts the
                best technicians around who are up-to-date on the hybrid
                industry’s training and education. To stay on top, we complete
                in-house exercises every month with our own instructor.
                Additionally, we travel the country to receive the best hybrid
                car repair schooling in the nation.
