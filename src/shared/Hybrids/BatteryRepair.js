              <h3>Hybrid Battery Replacement – Do you need it?</h3>
              <p>
                Talk with hybrid owners and you’ll hear one common question –{" "}
                <i>“How long do you think the battery will last?”</i> Naturally
                this is a concern for our clients. Hybrid battery replacement is
                expensive – costing anywhere from $2,000-$10,000. Most auto
                dealerships would tell you to replace the battery after it
                reaches a certain age. Our team of experts at Savage Automotive
                takes a different approach. Before even considering hybrid
                battery replacement, we run your battery through a series of
                tests. These tests tell us if we are able to condition the
                battery or if the battery does need to be replaced.
              </p>

                  Strong battery power is essential for optimal performance., If
                  your car isn't getting proper acceleration or you notice its
                  fuel efficiency has changed, it might be time for hybrid
                  battery conditioning.

              <p>
                One way to prolong hybrid battery life is by hybrid battery
                conditioning. You could say that the battery is as strong as its
                weakest module. Hybrid battery conditioning is a process that
                repairs individual battery parts instead of replacing the entire
                battery. First, we use the most advanced technology in the
                industry to test the energy and power capacity. Once the results
                of the tests are analyzed and we have a sense of its condition,
                we replace any bad modules, recharge and balance the battery. In
                most cases, we’d rather repair your battery than suggest you get
                a new one.

                  The success of battery conditioning depends on a few factors:
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Operating at low capacity for a long time</b> – Sometimes the
                battery can’t be reconditioned if it’s worn out.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>The age of battery</b> – Preventive maintenance goes a long
                way. An older battery may have modules that do not recover.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Location and use of the vehicle</b> – Whether you drive your
                car in a wet or dry climate, in the city or in the mountains,
                the geographical location and use of the vehicle affects battery
                longevity.
